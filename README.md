# SQL Weekly Challenge

Welcome to the Weekly SQL Challenge! This project documents my journey through the challenge, where I tackled various SQL problems, from basic to advanced, and had some fun along the way.

## Credit

I want to give a huge shoutout to Danny for creating this challenge. It's been a fantastic learning experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

## Running the Queries

All the SQL queries in this project were executed using Azure Data Studio and also tested on DB Fiddle.

## Budget-Friendly Validation

As much as I'd love to validate my solutions with the official ones, my budget said otherwise. So, expect a dash of humor and some creative problem-solving instead!

Happy querying!
